The vertices of a graph of n vertices can be arranged linearly, forming a sequence
as in Fig. 1. The position of vertex v in the linear arrangement is π(v) (the 1st
vertex of the sequence is in position 0 and the last vertex of the sequence is in
position n − 1. In such a layout of a graph, the distance between two vertices
u and v is defined as |π(v) − π(u)|. Thus consecutive vertices in the linear
arrangement are at distance 1. The sum of distances between linked vertices is

where E is the set of edges of the graph. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the same graph
but with a different linear arrangement of the vertices. In Fig. 1 (a), D = 13,
while D =
