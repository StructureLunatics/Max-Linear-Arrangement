### 1. Choices and difficulties & Test cases

- Program 1
- Program 2
- Program 3
- Program 4
- Program 5



- Test cases:

  - Empty

  - Duplicate edges

  - 0 Edges

    


### 2. Ideas or tricks you have applied to improve efficiency of the algorithms

- Create a vector containing the computed distances of each graph is more efficient



### 3. Branch & Bound technique

- 




### 4. Running time & PC specifications

| Program | Compilation | Test suit | t_i  | r_i  |
| :-----: | :---------: | :-------: | :--: | :--: |
|    1    |     YES     |    YES    |  X   |  X   |
|    2    |     YES     |    YES    |      |  X   |
|    3    |     YES     |    YES    |      |      |
|    4    |     YES     |    YES    |      |      |
|    5    |     YES     |    YES    |      |      |

- PC specifications:
Redirecting the input only will give an unreliable time estimate.
Please, specify the units of time and the characteristics of the com-
puter with which you measured time: speed in GHz, number of cores,
type of processor and manufacturer and the type of disk where the
files are located: hard drive disk (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD)
